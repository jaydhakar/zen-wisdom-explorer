"""Answer generation via the chat model.

The model grounds its answer strictly in the retrieved passages (which are in the
same language as the request — each index is monolingual), replies in that
language, keeps it to 3-4 spoken-friendly sentences, and returns the exact
fallback sentence when the passages don't actually address the question.

For multi-turn conversations, prior {question, answer} turns are supplied as
context so follow-ups make sense — but retrieval still uses only the current
question, so the answer must still be grounded in the current passages.
